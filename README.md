## What is Federation Project?

---

The Federaiton-Project aims to provide a clear example on how to use the [GalactaGraph Boilerplate](https://github.com/emanuele-moricci/galactagraph-boilerplate)e to reduce the countless hours spent setting up and bootstrapping a NodeJS+GraphQL application with a Federated Schema.

It is designed to be used with the [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io) ORM and multiple Postgres databases, and offers typescript generation at runtime using [GraphQL Codegen](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/).

<br />

## Quick Start

---

### Database

- Install PostgresQL
- Enter the environment with the command `psql`
- Create a database with the command `create database <DB_NAME>;`

### Back-End (do this for every service under **services/**)

- Install the dependencies using `yarn`
- Create the `.env`, `.env.test` and `.env.docker.test` files using the `.env.example` file and add the DB connection string to the `DATABASE_URL` key

### Gateway

- Go to the root of the `server/` in the command line
- Follow the guide to register and run your gateway with all of the services through [Apollo Studio](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/quickstart/); Register the API key, the subgraphs through the rover module and create your project in Apollo Studio with the **Managed Mode**. When prompted to publish your federated schema, fill the data in the micro-service and gateway `.env` files and do one of the following steps:

  - **[ONLY FOR THE FIRST TIME]** Go to the `federation-auth` service, fire up the command `yarn dev`, then open up another terminal and fire up the command `yarn apollo:update`
  - **[FOR EVERY OTHER TIME]** In the gateway `package.json` there are several commands powered by bash files that can help you with the setup. Fire up the `yarn federation:dev` command and the `yarn federation:publish` command on another terminal to start and update the entire supergraph on Apollo Studio.

<br />

## How to START

---

### Without Docker

- Go to the root of the gateway and start the federation ecosystem with `yarn federation:dev`

### With Docker

- Go to the root of the project and start the dockerized ecosystem with `yarn docker:up` (for the docker version, check the `POSTGRESQL_DATABASES` url in your `.env` files and make sure that every database you need is correctly written there)

### Optional Steps

- update the supergraph by running `yarn federation:publish` on another terminal while the application is running
- Check your [Apollo Studio Web Environment](https://studio.apollographql.com/)
- Fire up the command `yarn prisma:studio` to get the Prisma GUI OR use your **DBMS** of choice

<br />

## How to TEST

---

### Database

- Install PostgresQL
- Enter the env with the command `psql`
- Create a database with the command `create database <DB_NAME>_test;` (or use your personal naming convention)

### Back-End

- Go into the `env.test` and `env.docker.test` file and change the `DATABASE_URL` connection string. Add the database name to the `POSTGRESQL_DATABASES` key in the `.env.docker.test` file in the gateway
- Create your test under the micro-service folder `__tests__/(integration or unit)` with the pattern `*.test.ts or *.unit.test.ts`
- Go to the root of the project and fire the testing command: `yarn federation:test` or `yarn federation:docker:test`

## How-to GUIDES

<p style=margin-left:20px>
GalactaGraph can take care of a lot of code by itself, but it cannot be of much help if you don't know some stuff first, here are some guides to help you get started:

- [Apollo Federation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/quickstart/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html)
- [GraphQL Codegen](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/docs/getting-started/index)
- [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/quickstart)

</p>
<br />
<p style=margin-left:20px>
Aside from that, there can be moments where you need to bind two models from different subgraphs, with different relations, add new non-model mutations, create new GraphQL fields with resolvers ecc...
</p>
<p style=margin-left:20px>
For that you can find everything you need here, or in this README file:
